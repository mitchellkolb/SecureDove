# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on our local machine:
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../SecureDove/`

To run the frontend:
1. install node.js
2. in the frontend directory, run the command "npm install" to enable node modules
3. in the same directory, run the command "npm start" to initialize app

To run the backend:
1. travel to the /backend directory
2. run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install libraries needed
3. run command "uvicorn main:app" to run backend on local port 8000
